The password generator was one of my first projects in this course. I've learned so much since then. When I first did this project, I didn't know what conditionals and loops were. Originally, i created all of these circles by hand. I'm happy I had the learning experience, because I can truly see the criticality regarding for-loops. I fixed by code by creating for-loops instead of the hand-typed circles. I also learned so much from organization. I cleaned up the code, so its easier to review and debug for future reference.
